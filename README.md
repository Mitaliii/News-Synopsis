Extractive summarization means identifying important parts of the text and making it verbatim produce a subset of sentences from the original text; while abstractive summarization reproduces important material in new ways after the interpretation and examination of texts using advanced natural language techniques to produce new, shorter texts that convey the most critical information from the original.

Extractive summarization is done on the basis of occurence frequency of words(except stopwords). Whereas abstractive summary is based on T5 Transfoermer
T5 is a new transformer model from Google that is trained in an end-to-end manner with text as input and modified text as output. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple NLP tasks like summarization, question answering, machine translation etc using a text-to-text transformer trained on a large text corpus.
